## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Agile and Waterfall methodologies differ fundamentally in their approach to project management. Agile is iterative and flexible, emphasizing incremental development and continuous feedback, which makes it well-suited for dynamic environments where requirements frequently change. In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, with distinct phases such as planning, design, development, and testing, making it ideal for projects with well-defined and static requirements.

Agile fosters collaboration and involves customers throughout the project, ensuring the final product aligns closely with user needs. Testing is continuous, and deliverables are released incrementally, allowing for faster time-to-market and early issue resolution. However, Agile's flexibility can lead to scope creep, unpredictable timelines, and reliance on highly skilled teams.

On the other hand, Waterfall provides a clear structure with extensive documentation, making it easier to track progress and manage expectations. It is predictable, with budgets and timelines established upfront. However, its rigidity makes adapting to changes costly, and testing occurs only at the end, increasing the risk of discovering critical issues late.
